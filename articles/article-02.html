                            We are proposing to develop a messaging application with additional functionalities like to-do list, bill splitting which will make it easier 
                            for people to chat with their friends and plan their next trip without switching apps. We think our application will be most useful for roommates 
                            to plan their finances and keep track of the spending. The main features of our application will be group messaging, to-do list, expenditure tracking, 
                            summary of the expenditure and if possible, we want to integrate banking system in our application.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    
                </div>

                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-8 offset-2 justify-content-start">
                        <p>
                            For the frontend, we will have a chat window, a to-do list window and an expenditure tracking window. We plan to add sign in / sign out features 
                            to our application. We plan on using React for the frontend portion of our application. For the backend, we will need store all the text messages, 
                            the status of to-do list and the expenditure tracking. As for the database, we are planning on using MongoDB. We need to store the to-do list and 
                            expenditure tracker with the most up-to date data.
                        </p>
